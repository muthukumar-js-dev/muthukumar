# Hi, I'm Muthu Kumar 👋

Backend Engineer, Open-Source Contributor, and Product Builder.

I work primarily with **Node.js and the MERN stack**, focusing on building scalable backend systems, developer tools, and real-world products.

I care deeply about **engineering fundamentals** — performance, architecture, maintainability — and sharing knowledge through open learning.

## 🔧 Engineering Focus
- Backend systems & API design
- Node.js internals (Event Loop, V8, async I/O)
- Authentication, authorization, and security
- Scaling, caching, and system reliability

## 🌍 Open Source
I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and building tools that help developers:

- Writing clean, review-friendly code
